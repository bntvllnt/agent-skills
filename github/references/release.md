# Releases (gh release)

Use this section as the entry point for release operations.

**MANDATORY: Read `release-strategy.md` before creating or editing any release.** It defines versioning rules, title format, description format, and the generation protocol.

| Intent | Reference |
|---|---|
| **strategy / format / versioning** | **`release-strategy.md`** |
| create / publish release | `release-create.md` |
| list / view / edit / delete release | `release-manage.md` |
| upload / download assets, verify attestations | `release-assets.md` |

## Read-only quick checks

```bash
gh release list
gh release view vX.Y.Z
```
